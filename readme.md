# Puzzle piece detection, counting and clustering: an edge-detection approach to image segmentation
 
Student: Luan Vin√≠cius de Carvalho Martins

In this project, we aim to identify, count, and cluster puzzle pieces with similar shapes. This task can be useful as a common technique to solving large piece puzzles is to [group pieces with similar features together](https://ceaco.com/blogs/news/tips-tricks-completing-1000-piece-puzzle).    

Project goals:
 - Detect and count puzzle pieces from images;
 - Extract the shape of the piece;
 - Cluster pieces with the similar shape together.

Related activities: This project employs edge-detection, morphology techniques, and image measurements and characterization for shape matching.
