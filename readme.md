# Puzzle piece detection, counting and clustering: an edge-detection approach to image segmentation
 
Student: Luan Vin√≠cius de Carvalho Martins

In this project, we aim to identify, count, and cluster puzzle pieces with similar shapes. This task can be useful as a common technique to solving large piece puzzles is to [group pieces with similar features together](https://ceaco.com/blogs/news/tips-tricks-completing-1000-piece-puzzle).    

Project goals:
 - Detect and count puzzle pieces from images;
 - Extract the shape of the piece;
 - Cluster pieces with the similar shape together.

Related activities: This project employs edge-detection, morphology techniques, and image measurements and characterization for shape matching. 

## Final report

The final report is available [here](/final-report/final-report.ipynb). It improves the descriptions of the methods on the partial report, highlights the differences, and shows the results with the improved method, which was able to generate higher quality segmentation by combining image enhancement techniques. The notebook contains the source code, which can be used to analyze more images if necessary for evaluation.

## Partial report

The partial report is still available [here](/partial-report/preliminary-results.ipynb). It contains the first version of the final report describing the methodology and techniques used. The preliminary results, which were improved by the final report, are also presented.
